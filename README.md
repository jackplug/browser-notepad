browser-notepad
===============

A basic in-browser notepad with localStorage

- Chrome - full support
- Firefox - full support (although you will have to hit Enter at the end of a line unless you don't mind horizontal scrolling)
- IE10 - support (no localStorage when running locally - needs to run from server)
- IE9 - support (no localStorage when running locally - needs to run from server); no lined paper :)
